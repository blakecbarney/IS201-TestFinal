    <h2>History of College Football</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        College football began in the late 19th century as a rough, loosely organized contest that 
        resembled rugby more than the modern game. The first officially recognized college football 
        matchup took place on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers and Princeton met in a match governed by 
        soccer-style rules. Players couldn’t carry the ball, and scoring came from kicking it into a 
        goal. Even in this early form, the sport captured attention and ignited interest at colleges 
        across the Northeast.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the 1870s and 1880s, teams across the country began experimenting with rules. Harvard, 
        influenced by a match with McGill University of Canada, adopted more rugby-like rules that 
        allowed ball carrying and tackling. This innovation reshaped the game and pushed it closer 
        to its modern identity. College rivalries intensified, and by the mid-1880s the annual 
        Harvard–Yale game had become a defining sporting event in American culture. However, the lack 
        of standardized rules and protective equipment led to alarming levels of injuries and even 
        fatalities.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the early 1900s, public criticism escalated, and President Theodore Roosevelt urged schools 
        to either reform the game or risk its elimination. In 1906, universities responded by forming 
        the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States—today known as the NCAA. This 
        organization introduced major rule changes, including the legalization of the forward pass, 
        the creation of a neutral zone at the line of scrimmage, and restrictions on dangerous 
        mass-formation plays. These changes made the game safer and laid the foundation for modern 
        offensive strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the early and mid-20th century, college football expanded nationwide. Major programs 
        rose to prominence in the Midwest and South, including Notre Dame, Michigan, Alabama, and 
        Oklahoma. Legendary coaches such as Knute Rockne, Bear Bryant, and Woody Hayes became icons, 
        shaping the sport’s culture and inspiring generations. The arrival of radio broadcasts in the 
        1920s and the widespread adoption of television in the 1950s propelled college football into 
        millions of homes and strengthened the tradition of Saturday game days.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the late 20th century, the sport had become a massive cultural and financial enterprise. 
        Bowl games multiplied, conferences reorganized, and TV networks paid unprecedented sums for 
        broadcasting rights. However, controversies surrounding the crowning of a national champion 
        persisted, leading to the introduction of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) in 1998. Though 
        an improvement, the BCS often faced criticism for relying heavily on rankings and computer 
        formulas.
    </p>

    <p>
        To further improve fairness and excitement, the College Football Playoff (CFP) debuted in 2014, 
        creating a four-team postseason tournament. The expanded twelve-team format introduced in 2024 
        marked another major evolution, increasing access for teams across all conferences. Today, 
        college football stands as a beloved American tradition, blending pageantry, passion, and 
        nonstop drama. From its rugged beginnings on Ivy League lawns to the massive stadiums and 
        nationwide fandom of today, the sport continues to unite communities and captivate fans every 
        Saturday in the fall.
